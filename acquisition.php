                                <p>Deal flow is a very important part of our Real Estate Investment Banking Group. AAs are trained to identify potential deals regardless of where they are discovered. Our investment group have added a very unique division that is responsible for acquisitions. MSW Investors is our Acquisition Director. It is where deal flow is originated and our Acquisition Associates are based. AAs are an essential component of the group and the expertise is very diverse with each one specializing in a particular discipline and geographical area. The AA’s role is somewhat similar to their cousins Investment Bankers except that we do not represent third parties.
